# My Journey Learning WordPress Theme Development

I've been diving into WordPress theme development recently, and I wanted to share what I've learned so far. It's been quite the journey from understanding basic PHP to creating actual functioning WordPress themes!

## Starting with the Basics

The first thing I learned was that a WordPress theme really only needs two files to work:
- `style.css` (with the theme information in the header)
- `index.php` (the main template file)

I started with just these files, creating a super simple theme that only displayed "Hello World". It wasn't much, but seeing my own theme appear in the WordPress admin panel was pretty exciting!

## The Famous WordPress Loop

One of the most interesting things I've learned is the WordPress Loop. At first, it looked complicated:

```php
while(have_posts()) {
    the_post(); 
    // Display post content here
}
```

But it's actually pretty straightforward once you understand it. The Loop is just WordPress's way of going through posts one at a time. I've learned to use it for:
- Showing blog posts on the home page
- Displaying single posts
- Creating page templates

## Templates: More Than Just Pages

I discovered that WordPress uses different template files for different types of content. Here's what I've created so far:
- `single.php` for individual blog posts
- `page.php` for static pages
- `header.php` and `footer.php` to keep my code DRY

## Learning About Headers and Footers

Breaking my theme into header and footer files made things much cleaner. The key functions I learned were:
- `wp_head()` for the header
- `wp_footer()` for the footer
- `get_header()` and `get_footer()` to include them in other templates

## What's Next?

I'm still learning, and there's so much more to explore:
- Custom post types
- Theme customization
- Advanced template features
- WordPress functions and hooks

I'm keeping all my code and notes in this repository as I learn. Feel free to check it out if you're on a similar learning journey!

## Notes to Self

Things I want to remember:
- Always check the WordPress Codex when stuck
- Test changes frequently
- Keep the code organized
- Comment everything for future reference

I'll keep updating this as I learn more. It's been fun figuring this out step by step!
